Allsafe Access is a comprehensive remote access solution that consists of three main components: `allsafe-auth`, `allsafe-cli`, and `allsafe-proxy`. Together, these components provide a secure, auditable, and managed way to access remote systems.

`allsafe-auth` is the Certificate Authority (CA) for the system. It is responsible for generating and managing the self-signed Root CA and issuing certificates for the other components. The `allsafe-auth` CLI can also import an existing external CA, allowing it to integrate into an organization's existing Public Key Infrastructure (PKI). It also issues sample certificates for the proxy and agent for demonstration purposes.

`allsafe-proxy` acts as a central gateway, mediating all communication between clients and agents. It enforces authentication, authorization, and audit logging to ensure secure and auditable remote access. The proxy manages the registration and lifecycle of remote agents using heartbeats and enforces fine-grained, role-based access control (RBAC). It provides administrative endpoints for managing users via secure invitations, listing active sessions, and terminating sessions. The proxy also logs security events to a SQLite database for monitoring and compliance.

`allsafe-cli` is the command-line client for the Allsafe Access system. It allows users to securely authenticate with the `allsafe-proxy` and connect to remote agents. The CLI offers an interactive shell with features like auto-completion and command history for a user-friendly experience. Users can list all accessible nodes and connect to a remote agent's interactive shell. The `allsafe-cli` also supports multi-factor authentication (MFA) to enhance security.
